Exploring Different types of Supervised Learning Classifications within the Scikit-Learn package. 


Exploring Kaggle Titanic data. Evaluating different types of Model Classifications through a boxplot.
This can be copied across for other types of Supervised learning Classification problems.

Note the numerical and categorical pipeline used to 'Fix' the data. This code does not include Fine tuning the model (i.e.
RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV and other ensemble methods could be used) or testing with the test data, this purely includes the
assessment and evaluation of models. 

The code includes:

1. Data exploration
2. Data fixing through numerical and categorical pipelines
3. Model selection
4. Model Evaluation
5. Summary
